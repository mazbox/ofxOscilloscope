ofxOscillator
=============

This is a basic oscilloscope. See SimpleOscilloscopeExample for usage. 
You can set:
	- vertical position
	- vertical gain
	- timebase
	- trigger level
	- trigger direction
	- auto (one push)

There's also a pause button. Pause also can be controlled by the space bar.

Trigger Hold off time doesn't work yet.

You can set these by accessing the public variables of ofxOscilloscope.

The xmlGuiOscilloscopeExample is using my forthcoming xmlgui library.

There's a compiled mac version in ofxOscilloscope.zip

enjoy
