This is a basic oscilloscope. See SimpleOscilloscopeExample for usage. 
You can set:
	- vertical position
	- vertical gain
	- timebase
	- trigger level
	- trigger direction
	
You can set these by accessing the public variables of ofxOscilloscope.

The other settings aren't implemented

The xmlGuiOscilloscopeExample is using my forthcoming xmlgui library.
